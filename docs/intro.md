Hello, I am the creator of Interlang. Interlang is my programming language in Python. I created this programming language because I want to learn more about how programming languages work.

Interlang is as the name says an interpreted language. It is stack based and still under development so it would be very important to me that you support me <3.

Interlang has operations that consist of an operation header that declares the operation and parameters that sometimes give additional information. There are also labels that consist of declaration and code, they allow you to create branches with conditional JUMP operations (more on that later). Variables also exist and are declared with VAR (more on this also later).
